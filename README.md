# Data Cleaning and Preprocessing Showcase

Welcome to the **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing Showcase** repository! This collection of projects aims to demonstrate my expertise in data cleaning and preprocessing techniques within the field of data science. Each project in this repository showcases my skills in handling real-world datasets, addressing data quality issues, and preparing data for meaningful analysis and modeling.

## Why Data Cleaning and Preprocessing?

Data is the foundation of any data science project, and ensuring its quality and reliability is paramount for accurate insights and models. Data cleaning and preprocessing involve a series of essential steps that refine raw data into a structured, clean, and usable format. This repository is designed to highlight how I approach these steps and showcase my ability to transform messy data into valuable insights.

## What You'll Find

Each project in this repository demonstrates various aspects of data cleaning and preprocessing, including:
- Handling missing values through imputation techniques.
- Detecting and treating outliers that could skew results.
- Transforming and scaling features for optimal model performance.
- Feature engineering to extract meaningful insights from the data.
- Visualizing data distributions and the impact of preprocessing steps.

## Projects

Here's a list of projects you'll find in this repository:
- [Project 1: House Prices Data Cleaning]: Cleaning and preprocessing a real estate dataset to enhance its usability for modeling.
